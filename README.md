# Academic Pages
**Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.**

# Getting Started

## Daily Manager single-page app usage

The `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` files in the repository root make up the Daily Manager front-end. There is no backend or build step required. To run it locally:

1. Clone or download this repository so the three files stay together (keeping the repository structure is sufficient).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` in your file browser, or
   - Right-click and choose “Open with browser”, or
   - Start an optional temporary static server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html.
3. The app starts in the Europe/London timezone and persists data to `localStorage` using the keys `dm_journal`, `dm_todos`, `dm_labLogs`, `dm_dayRatings`, `dm_ledger`, `dm_ledgerHistory`, and `dm_settings`. Click the timezone label below the title to switch between Europe/London and China. Refreshing the page keeps your data intact.
4. Track daily todos and capture a "Rate my day" score (0–10) with work time, training time, and a commit summary beside the selected date. Research logs capture an experiment title, overview, code notes or URLs, detailed auto time-stamped steps, and optional results independent of the calendar view.
5. Record balances in the Ledger panel under the todo list. Alipay, WeChat, and Bank Account (cn) values roll into the Total row automatically, while Bank Account (uk) Debt stays independent of the daily calendar. Use the ＋/－ shortcuts beside each account to log income or expenses without touching the base value—each adjustment is tracked per day in the history list beneath the ledger, and you can remove an entry later if it was added by mistake.
6. Use the Back to today button above the calendar to jump to the current day. Calendar stars turn green when every todo for that date is complete; otherwise they stay yellow/orange/red based on how far the day is from today and display any recorded work/training times beside the star.
7. To archive or migrate your information, pick a date range in the export card at the bottom of the page and download TXT files for todos or research logs.

> If you only need the Jekyll site, continue with the existing “Running locally” section below.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

## Running locally

When you are initially working your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
    On MacOS the commands are:
    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    brew install node
    gem install bundler
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

If you are running on Linux it may be necessary to install some additional dependencies prior to being able to run locally: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc make`

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Start by build the container:

```bash
docker build -t jekyll-site .
```

Next, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app jekyll-site
```

# Maintenance

Bug reports and feature requests to the template should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is © 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii) and additional maintainers would be welcomed.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch.
